07.12.2012 - published on codeplex http://stsdbmtl.codeplex.com - multi-threaded layer for STSdb. 
			 Later this layer, its enhanced variant, became a prototype for DBreeze multi-threaded layer.
			 We must say, that our implementation of the search trie itself and data storage strategy
			 has nothing mutual with STSdb and has absolutely other approaches, 
			 no parts of their source code was taken or used in DBreeze production.
